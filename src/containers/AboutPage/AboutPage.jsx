                    Hello! I'm Karthick Shankar, a senior at Purdue University pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. 
                    I am fascinated and enthusiastic about technology and I feel like I can bring about a positive change in the world. 
                    With a lot of experience behind me, I'm a seasoned developer and researcher. <br /><br />
                    I've published a couple papers in the field of computer vision and distributed systems! If you want to chat about any of these,
                    shoot me an email at shankak@purdue.edu.
